  Multi-Tenant MCP Gateway
  
  A single gateway that routes tool calls to multiple sandboxes based on
  tool name prefixes and user permissions. This is the recommended approach
  for most deployments as it reduces operational overhead while providing
  the same security and isolation benefits.
  
  Add new tool sets by:
  1. Deploying a new sandbox with your tools
  2. Adding configuration to this chart's values
  3. No new gateway deployment needed!
