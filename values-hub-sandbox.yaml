# Optimized values for Red Hat Developer Sandbox deployment
# This configuration is designed for resource-constrained environments
# where you cannot create new projects or install operators.
#
# Usage:
#   Use your existing project (e.g., ganelson-dev)
#   Deploy components manually or with Helm
#   See docs/DEVELOPER-SANDBOX-GUIDE.md for step-by-step instructions

clusterGroup:
  name: hub

  # In Developer Sandbox, you use your assigned project
  # You cannot create new namespaces
  namespaces: []

  # Developer Sandbox typically doesn't allow operator installation
  # Use direct deployments instead

    - hub

  applications:
    # Note: In Developer Sandbox, deploy these manually
    # The pattern (make install) may not work without operators

    # Keycloak - deploy directly without operator

# Developer Sandbox limitations and workarounds:
# 1. Cannot create projects: Use your assigned project
# 2. Cannot install operators: Use direct deployments
# 3. Limited resources: Components configured with minimal requirements
# 4. No cluster-admin: Some features may not work
# 5. Temporary environment: Data is not persisted long-term
